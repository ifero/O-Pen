## Design and Evaluation of an Open-Source Pen for Tabletops

### Introduction

Pens were the first pointing device of computers. Since 1950s we were used to have a pen that, pointed to the monitor, was interacting with the computer.
In 1980s were replaced by mice and in 2000s started the first touch screen devices, in which the user could use the fingers instead of pens or mice, to point and interact with the device. 
With the advent of this touch devices users started to critic believe that fingers could substitute pens and mice for interact with the computer. 
But some researcher, as Bill Buckston, believe that for interacting with touch devices, as tabletops, the best solution is not the finger or the pen, but both. 
In some cases fingers are not the best choice, such as in certain laboratory in with fingers are covered by protection gloves. 
Some research show that the pen is better than a finger for specific precise works such as writing, signing and drawing. 
In literature there are several researches on pens for tabletops, some of them are focused on studying specific interaction movements of the pen while using it;
some others create their own pen and application and show how it can be used. But none of them is giving an open-source model to continue the work. 
Thus, every project start over again to create a pen. Another important thing is that none of them also compare different techniques with each others. 
that's why we want to put the first stone on open-source pens for tabletops.
